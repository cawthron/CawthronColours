# CawthronColours

## package in development - not yet functional!

The goal of CawthronColours is to to provide official Cawthron colour
palettes for use in R. The colour palettes are a mix of well known
(e.g. viridis) and custom palettes. All are colour blind friendly.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CawthronColours like so:

``` r
if (!require("CawthronColours")) install.packages("CawthronColours")
remotes::install_gitlab("cinst/cawthron-internal-tools/CawthronColours")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(CawthronColours)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
